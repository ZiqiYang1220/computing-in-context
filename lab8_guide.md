# Lab 8 guide

## Setup

1. [Install the Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) (called "Anaconda" for short), if you haven't already.
1. [Open Anaconda Navigator.](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/getting-started/#starting-navigator)
1. Navigate to [Environments](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/).
1. [Ensure](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#searching-for-packages) `pandas` and `plotly` are installed.
1. Launch JupyterLab.

## Try it!

Run [this example](https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/#linear-fit-trendlines-with-plotly-express).

_FYI `px.data.tips()` loads one of [Plotly's sample datasets](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.data.html). You don't need that when plotting other datasets._

Once that's working, start [Lab 8](lab8.ipynb)!
