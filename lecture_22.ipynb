This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>RE:  DOCKET NUMBER DOT-OST-2018-0068I am a psychotherapist who has worked with many people with PTSD and Severe panic attacks.  I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.</td>\n",

As I have read the pending rules, only a properly trained service dog would fulfill the criteria to accompany a passenger with special needs in the cabin. The wide and random acceptance of  non-professional trained emotional support animals in the cabin of aircraft would cease. This is essential for the health and safety of the passengers at large as well as the hard working crew. I hope to see this change made very soon. Thank you.   \n",

I have spoken with men whose PTSD, from serving in the military, has been so severe that they cannot go anywhere without their emotional support animals.  I have also treated people who have such bad  panic attacks that they become paralyzed or sometimes even faint.I implore you to not take away the privilege of these people having their ESAs on planes, to provide necessary comfort.  Just because you cannot see a disorder, doesn't mean  it doesn't exist.  I liken it to a domestic violence survivor who was emotionally abused.  His or her pain can be just as great as one who was physically abused.You will be doing a  tremendous disservice to people who legitimately need their ESAs, if you don't let these people travelwith them.  How can passengers prove that the service their ESAs serve is to help them feel safe? This is not an observerable task.Clearly people have abused this policy and that couldn't be more wrong.  However, there must be a better solution than what the DOT is proposing.  Some airlines are having passengers sign waivers that their pets are well-trained.  Can't that be enough?  Also, can't the proposal just consider allowing people with just dogs and cats as ESAs?Please consider what I have said.  If this rule is instituted, many people's lives will be severely negatively affected.Thank you.  \n",
       "4    I really appreciate the time that has been spent to really create a workable definition for what should reasonably considered a service animal. I would like to take the time to comment as a frequent passenger of airlines, as my experience is limited to that specifically on the call for comment on restriction by breed. Cabin spaces can be incredibly confined and the presence of a dog that exhibits characteristics of Bully breeds might initially suggest that these dogs should be prohibited. However I would like to offer two counterpoints (1) Bully breeds vary in size and (2) Significant accommodation and allowance are made for large bags As in all breeds there is significant variance of size. While what some would consider pit bulls can be as large as boxers there are others that due to their mixed background are much smaller than a golden retriever or German shepherd which might be considered the poster dogs for service animals. Simply restricting on the basis of appearance of Bully breeding, is close but not sufficient as a workable definition and places legitimate service animals and their handlers at risk. Second, from a narrative standpoint, as a student I have consistently observed the large backpacks taken by students onto planes at the beginning or end of breaks. These bags stuffed with books, computers, and supplies are often too large to fit underneath the slightly smaller spaces allotted for the aisle and window seats. In my own experience, I have only known legitimate service dogs to sit in the front row where they have space to lay or in a separate reserved seat.  Given the tolerance we understandably extend to college students at the holidays, I think it would not be unreasonable to extend similar patience towards dogs that significantly improve and aid their handler's successful maneuvering through society.   \n",

Passengers claiming pets as emotional support animals threaten the safety and health of other passengers.  I was on a flight recently in which a unleashed dog was allowed to wander around the plane.  In addition to allergy problems for passengers, dogs can spread germs and bacteria.  Please ban all untrained emotional support animals.  \n",

Only dogs.  And even dogs should be severely restricted.  Emotional support animals should not be included.  The DOT should require a License of some type that those with service dogs must obtain.  It should require a statement from a medical professional re the need for the service dog and also a certificate showing training.I realize some people really need their service dog and of course am willing to make accomodations.  But other people have needs as well.  My wife is deathly afraid of dogs (even really small ones which I find amusing).  I am not afraid of dogs but I am severely allergic to dogs.  Planes are full of enough pathogens for all of us to worry about without having to worry about dog dander as well.  Thank you for your consideration.  \n",

This has been abused for way too long. Anyone can get a note from their vet and/or doctor saying that their poor pet is needed for emotional stability. Enough. Flying is for humans, not pets - at least not pets that share cabin seats. I would like it to be limited to only official & documented service dogs (not all animals). Enough with this attitude that my pet can go with me anywhere.  \n",
