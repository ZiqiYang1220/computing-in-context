# Notebooks

This site is built from Jupyter notebooks and Markdown files using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/). You can take a look at [the source code](https://github.com/afeld/computing-in-context), if curious.

## Downloading notebooks

For lecture slides / labs, download the page as a notebook to work with it locally.

1. Open the page for the Homework/Lecture on this site.
   - For example: [Lab 8](lab_8.ipynb)
1. Hover over the download icon (⬇️) in the toolbar at the top.
   - Feel free to move it to whatever folder you like.
1. You may then see the [notebook JSON](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html) - go to:
   1. `File` menu
   1. `Save Page As...`
1. [Open the notebook in JupyterLab.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/files.html#opening-files)

That is now your own copy; you can execute/add cells as you like, including adding your own notes in [Markdown cells](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). For Labs, the intention is for you to turn in the template via Gradescope, filled in with your code.
