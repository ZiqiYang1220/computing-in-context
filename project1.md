# Project 1

In this project, you will:

- Get the feel of working in a Jupyter Notebook
- Work with a new dataset
- Practice working with data in:
  - Pure Python
  - pandas

## Steps

1. Find a dataset you aren't familiar with.
   - It must have:
     - At least one numeric column
     - Between one thousand and one million rows
       - If it's larger than that, you can filter it down.
   - See [this list of open data portals](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/final_project/resources.html#open-data-portals).
   - Don't spend too long on this step.
1. Create a new notebook.
1. In pure Python (not using pandas, a spreadsheet program, etc):
   1. Read in the data.
   1. If there's more than one numeric column, pick one.
   1. Compute:
      - The mean
      - The median
      - The mode
1. Explain what you're doing and what you found using [Markdown cells](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).
1. Repeat steps 3-4 using pandas.
1. Turn in the notebook.
