# Lab 11 guide

**Goal:** Students should get practice with:

- Grouping
- Mapping
- Resampling
- Multi-line charts

Do the following all together, with students driving.

1. **~20 minutes:** Using [Street Tree Census data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh/about_data), make a choropleth map of the number of trees per Community District/Board.
   - [More info about the Census](https://www.nycgovparks.org/trees/treescount)
1. **~25 minutes:** Using [MTA ridership data](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew/about_data), view the bus ridership by day and month.
   - If you have time, make charts. Otherwise, showing in a table is fine.
1. **~25 minutes:** Work through Step 5 of the [Lab 11 Exercise](lab_11.ipynb) together.
1. **~20 minutes:** Independent work time for the rest.

While the [solutions for the first two](lab_11_solutions.ipynb) are available,

- Discourage students from looking at them before completing
- The solutions the group comes up with don't need to look like the provided ones
