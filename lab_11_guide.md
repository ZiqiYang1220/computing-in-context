# Lab 11 guide

**Goal:** Students should get practice with:

- Grouping
- Mapping
- Resampling
- Multi-line charts

Do the following in [the lab notebook](lab_11.ipynb) all together, with students driving.

1. **~20 minutes:** Street trees
1. **~25 minutes:** Buses
   - If you have time, make charts. Otherwise, showing in a table is fine.
1. 311 and COVID
   1. **~25 minutes:** Work through Step 5 together.
   1. **~20 minutes:** Independent work time for the rest.

While the [solutions for the first two sections](lab_11_solutions.ipynb) are available,

- Discourage students from looking at them before completing
- The solutions the group comes up with don't need to look like the provided ones
